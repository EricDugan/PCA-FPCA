## PCA of Waveforms and Functional PCA: A Primer for Biomechanics

Information within this repository relates to the publication:

Warmenhoven, J., Bargary, N., Liebl, D., Harrison, A., Robinson, M. A., Gunning, E., & Hooker, G. (2020). PCA of Waveforms and Functional PCA: A Primer for Biomechanics. Journal of Biomechanics, In Press, Available Online (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021929020305303).

This repository contains code for implementing functional principal components analysis (fPCA) and PCA of waveforms on an exemplar biomechanical data set. The implementation takes place using both Matlab and R demonstrations. 

Data for this tutorial can be taken from the Functional Data Analysis website at: www.functionaldata.org, or from within the fda R package once it has been downloaded. For any questions related to this tutorial (and script), please email john.warmenhoven@hotmail.com.

All content from this tutorial can be found in two key texts. All theoretical information underpinning the use of these processes can be found at Ramsay and Silverman (2005). Additionally, a useful text outlining computational approaches for applying these processes in Matlab and R can be found at Ramsay, Hooker and Graves (2009).
