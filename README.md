## PCA of Waveforms and Functional PCAâ€¦ do they differ?

This repository contains code for implementing functional principal components analysis (fPCA) and PCA of waveforms on an exemplar biomechanical data set. The implementation takes place using both Matlab and R demonstrations. 

Data for this tutorial can be taken from the Functional Data Analysis website at: www.functionaldata.org, or from within the fda R package once it has been downloaded. For any questions related to this tutorial (and script), please email john.warmenhoven@hotmail.com.

All content from this tutorial can be found in two key texts. All theoretical information underpinning the use of these processes can be found at Ramsay and Silverman (2005). Additionally, a useful text outlining computational approaches for applying these processes in Matlab and R can be found at Ramsay, Hooker and Graves (2009). These references have been displayed below.
